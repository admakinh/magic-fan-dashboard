# Orlando Magic Fan Hub

## Description

<!-- Intro/Features -->
For this group project, we created a fan page for the Orlando Magic. We built a site that fans can visit to stay up to date with their favorite team. Users can view scores from the most recent games, check when the team is playing next, review current league standings, and browse and search the latest team news.

<!-- Tools -->
This project utilizes several technologies and resources. We call upon NBA-API for game and season data to display our scores, schedule, and standings, and use the NewsCatcher API to supply our news. We use Moment.js to format dates for scores and schedule. <!-- jQuery --> <!-- local storage --> <!-- Bulma -->

<!-- Challenges -->
We faced several challenges while building this project. <!-- Insomnia --> <!-- CORS and XML --> <!-- player data --> <!-- Bulma -->

<!-- Future -->
Going forward with this project, we would like to add a players section that displays photos, statistics, personal infomration, and links to their social media accounts. We are also keen to extend this site to cover all NBA teams, and even expand into other popular sports leagues.
